### Secrets

Most corporate leaks on GitHub occur on developers’ personal public repositories, as opposed to official company’s open source repositories. In the vast majority of the cases, these leaks are unintentional, not malevolent. With 40M+ developers using GitHub, any company with a lot of developers is exposed to the platform.

Developers now build software in a decentralized, cloud and SaaS-friendly way. As a result, they increasingly use API keys, database credentials, private keys, certificates, ... This leads to secrets spreading within the organizations and the public domain.
